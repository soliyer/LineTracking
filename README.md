# Line Following Robot with RGB LED Control

## Description
This project is a line-following robot that uses RGB LEDs for visual feedback. The robot is designed to follow a line on the ground using sensors and control the LED colors based on its movements.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board
- Freenove WS2812B RGB LED Controller
- Motor driver
- Sensors for line detection
- Power supply

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Freenove_WS2812B_RGBLED_Controller library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the Arduino IDE and the necessary libraries.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
Once the code is uploaded and the robot is assembled, place it on a track with a line. The robot will follow the line and change LED colors based on its direction.
